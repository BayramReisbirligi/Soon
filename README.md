| :--- | :---:           | :---          |
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | <ul><li>Utilizes a basic three-tier architecture with separate files for presentation (`index.html`), styling (`style.css`), and logic (`script.js`).</li><li>Designed for simplicity and ease of understanding, suitable for small projects or prototypes.</li><li>Focuses on front-end technologies without backend integration.</li></ul> |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | <ul><li>Code is modularized into CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files, promoting separation of concerns.</li><li>JavaScript code in `script.js` is structured to handle time-sensitive features dynamically.</li><li>Uses clear naming conventions and structured formatting for maintainability.</li></ul> |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | <ul><li>Limited documentation with basic descriptions embedded within code files.</li><li>No extensive external documentation or API guides provided.</li><li>Inline comments in `style.css` and `script.js` enhance understandability.</li></ul> |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | <ul><li>Integrates external fonts and icons to enhance UI aesthetics.</li><li>No complex third-party service integrations.</li><li>Designed to be standalone with potential for future expansions.</li></ul> |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | <ul><li>Codebase is split into three main files, each handling a specific aspect of the web application.</li><li>Modular design allows for easy updates and maintenance.</li><li>Potential to expand each module independently as project scales.</li></ul> |
| 🧪 | **Testing**       | <ul><li>No formal testing framework or tests mentioned.</li><li>Relies on manual testing for functionality verification.</li><li>Opportunity to implement unit and integration tests for better reliability.</li></ul> |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | <ul><li>Lightweight dependencies (`html`, `css`, `javascript`) ensure fast load times.</li><li>Optimized CSS for responsive design contributes to better performance across devices.</li><li>JavaScript handles dynamic content efficiently without noticeable lag.</li></ul> |
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | <ul><li>No specific security measures detailed.</li><li>Basic web application without sensitive data handling or transactions.</li><li>Opportunity to enhance security as project requirements evolve.</li></ul> |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | <ul><li>Depends solely on basic web technologies: `<html>`, `<css>`, `<javascript>`.</li><li>No complex dependency management required.</li><li>Low risk of dependency-related issues due to the simplicity of the stack.</li></ul> |
